        <h2>Our principles</h2>
        <div>
          <div>
            <h3>We don't take sides</h3>
            Unlike other ballot guides, we do our best to be as nonpartisan as possible. We'll try
            to explain how the Yes and the No sides are trying to convince you and dive into the
            relevant research and reporting behind their claims. The issues tend to be pretty
            complicated, so we let you decide. Also, we recognize we don't know everything, or fully
            understand every perspective. If you know something we don't (regarding the props), send
            us the facts: <b>fax@ballot.fyi</b>.
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>We don't make or take money</h3>
            Unlike most people (and we all know corporations are people too), we don't make money
            and won't accept contributions. That's a feature. Mixed with politics, money is messy,
            and we'd probably lose your trust if there was some ulterior motive with this site.
            <br />
            <br /> In full transparency, we have asked for contributions in the past, and you can{' '}

              long={`In previous years, we have asked for donations from readers after the elections were over. (All were under $100.) We are discontinuing that practice. Also, in 2018, ballot.fyi received a grant from The Knight Foundation, a nonpartisan organization advancing media and information to aid democracy. We no longer have any obligation or affiliation to The Knight Foundation, or any other organization`}

          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>We let you explore</h3>
            Behind almost every sentence is research or reporting to back it up. We cite everything
            we can and give you avenues to explore in case you're curious or skeptical.

        <h2>Your vote goes beyond the Presidential race</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Understandably, you may feel like your vote, as a Californian, doesn't matter. Unless
            everyone pandemic-fled SF to move into their parents' basements in Ohio, California is
            all but certain to vote blue in the presidential election, electorally-speaking. So why
            tf should you vote? RHETORICAL QUESTION. Because we put weighty, consequential
            propositions on the ballot that sometimes become laws (or state constitutional
            amendments) for a hell-uh long time.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, we're voting on whether to make affirmative action legal again in CA. It
            was banned via ballot proposition 24 years ago. In 2016, a ballot prop was the vehicle
            for marijuana legalization. Own property? It's a really big deal this year that we might
            change Prop 13, a ballot prop voted in 1978, which sets the max for your property taxes.
            Oh, you don't have $1M so you rent? You get to decide whether cities can enact new rent
            control measures.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your decisions 100 million% matter. They might not directly affect you, but they might
            affect your friends, your future children, or even that nice colleague you fondly used
            to say hello to everyday but didn't actually know their name.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let's be honest â€“ convincing you to vote isn't the hard part. The hard part is finding
            the time and doing the work to understand the issues. We try to make that as easy as
            possible for you

        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <div>
          Ballot.fyi is designed, coded, and primarily written by Jimmy Chion, with the editorial
          help of many friends, left and right. Jimmy is a creative technologist at The New York
          Times. (This project is not affiliated in any way to The New York Times.) He started{' '}
          <LinkOut href="https://2016.ballot.fyi/">ballot.fyi in 2016</LinkOut>, and designed and
          wrote for it again in <LinkOut href="https://2018.ballot.fyi/">2018</LinkOut>.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ballot.fyi is entirely a side project, with the only goal of informing voters with
          to-the-point but explorable information, research, and reporting. It is built on top of
          the hard work of many local journalists and people with way more expertise than us. The
          best way to support ballot.fyi is to buy a subscription to your local paper.
