## Our goals
ballot.fyi will be the most straightforward and accessible guide to California's ballot propositions in 2020. To create a more accessible site, we'll optimize for readability, accessible web design patterns, and modes of learning to educate the most people possible.

### Voice and style
We aim to provide a nonpartisan, no-bull, free resource for California voters. Our guide is nonpartisan to ensure that we weigh all sides equally, explaining all legitimate arguments and facts as empathetically as possible. We explain issues as if we're explaining it to a friend, but with 100% accuracy, given the best information we can find. Our voice is somewhat irreverent, but not imparting an opinion.

### Accessibility
- Mobile-first
- printable
- Screen reader-friendly
- visual options for high-contrast, monochrome colors, no/reduced motion
- audio version of primary texts

### Donations, gifts
We do **not** accept any money, gifts, favors, or promise of those from any individuals, companies, or advertisers.

By the election, we hope to have served over 1 million California residents, surpassing the 2016 edition's metrics. More viewers simply means more reach – our site will not display ads, nor store any personal information for any use.

### Social media targeting
Our goal is to be the guide that you share with your friends, but because Facebook encompasses a much larger network than most millennials and Gen-Z'ers close friends, efforts in 2020 will focus on Twitter sharing. Norms around sharing provide an appropriate amount of gravity. Facebook has limited the spread of political content,
